## Take Control of MyAnimeList.net


**BetterMyAnimeList** is a full-featured Chrome extension built to add useful features to the most famous anime related website [MyAnimeList.net](). 

With **BetterMyAnimeList** you can, for example, watch any anime and read any manga through MyAnimeList.net using the streaming and watching tabs provided on either the anime or manga page.

### Autocomplete as you type in the search bar!

Whether you are looking for an anime or a manga **BetterMyAnimeList** will give you beautiful and resourceful previews of all the returned results as you type in the search bar. The entries are rendered below the search bar in an elegant and suitable way.

In each of the entries you will find:

*  Title
*  Status (airing...)
*  Thumbnail (you can click on it to either watch the anime or read the manga)
*  Type (TV...)
*  Number of episodes/chapters
*  Score
*  Synopsis
*  'Edit/Add to the list' button 

### The fastest and simplest streaming/reading system ever created

You will no longer have to step out of [MyAnimeList.net]() to watch anime or read manga because **BetterMyAnimeList** will find all of them for you. In fact, the streaming/reading feature is available by clicking the 'watching'/'reading' tabs for any anime/manga page available on [MyAnimeList.net](). 

##### Streaming

* It is much more faster
* It is Ad-free
* It is Lag-free (your page won't slow down at all)

What the streaming feature allows you to do:

* Choose the subtitle's language (see sources system below)
* Choose the episode
* Choose the resolution/quality
* Turn on/Turn off immersive mode

### An extremely useful sources system

**BetterMyAnimeList** has also been given an extremely useful sources system allowing to choose how the media should be provided for both the streaming and reading. 

Here's how the sources system works:

1. It retrieves the episodes/chapters
2. It retrieves the resolutions/pages depending on the current episodes/chapters
3. It plays the media

The sources system allows you to choose:

- The media's language
- The media's subtitle language
- The media's location (country, city...)

**N.B**: 'Media' refers to either an anime or a manga.

### BetterMyAnimeList doesn't stop there 

In addition to all the previously mentioned features, **BetterMyAnimeList** has also a lot of others 'not well known' features such as:

- A BBCode toolbar located above any textarea to write your message faster
- A detailed history of watched anime/read manga 


A non-exhaustive list of the expected features:
